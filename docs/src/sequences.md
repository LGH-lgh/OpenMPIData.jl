# Sequences

Several MPI measurement sequences have been used for data
acquisition. All parameters are described in the following

# 2D Lissajous Sequence

| Parameter                  |     Value                        |
| ---------------------------| -------------------------------- |
| Drive-Field Amplitude      |   12 mT x 12 mT x 0 mT           |
| Drive-Field Frequency      |   ??? x ??? x ???                |
| Selection-Field Gradient   |   -1.0 T/m x -1.0 T/m x 2.0 T/m  |
| Repetition Time            |    ??? ms                        |
| Number Measured Frames     |    1000                          |
