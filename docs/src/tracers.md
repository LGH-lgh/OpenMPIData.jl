# Tracers

As MPI is a tracer based imaging modality, it is important to relate all
measurements to the tracer being used. Currently most datasets are measured with perimag and
one system matrix is measured with synomag-D.

## Perimag
[Perimag](https://www.micromod.de/de/produkte-197-magnetisch_peri.html) is a dextran coated tracer from the
company Micromod. Perimag offers a very good MPI signal comparable to Resovist and can be directly ordered, which is essential for reproducible research.

## Synomag-D
[Synomag](https://www.micromod.de/en/produkte-230-magnetic_syno.html) is a dextran coated tracer from the
company Micromod as well. It provides up to a factor of 2 better signal than perimag.
