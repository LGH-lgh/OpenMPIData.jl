# Tracers

As MPI is a tracer based imaging modality, it is important to relate all
measurements to the tracer being used. Currently all datasets are measured with
the same tracer.

## Perimag
The tracer being used for the measurements is [Perimag](https://www.micromod.de/de/produkte-197-magnetisch_peri.html) from the
company Micromod. Perimag offers a very good MPI signal comparable and can be directly
ordered, which is essential for reproducible research.
