# Calibration

When using a system matrix based reconstruction algorithm one
usually uses calibration data to setup the system matrix. In the 
following we describe measured calibration datasets.

!!! note
    The calibration datasets are all measured on a 3D sampling grid 
    idependently of the excitation dimension. For 1D and 2D image 
    reconstruction it is advised to extract appropriate slices prior
    to reconstruction.
