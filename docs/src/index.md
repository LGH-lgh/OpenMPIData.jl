# Open MPI Data

Initiative for open Magnetic Particle Imaging Data

## Introduction

**This site is still under construction. Please do not use until this message is removed**

Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a tomograpic imaging technique that allows
to determine the spatial distribution of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). The aim
of this project is to provide MPI data that are openly available for the research
community and can be freely used. To facilate reproducable research all available
information including a detailed description of the used pahntoms and the applied
measurement sequences are provided.

All MPI data is stored in the [MPI Data Format (MDF)](https://github.com/MagneticParticleImaging/MDF).
The MDF provides a common data format for the storage of MPI raw data, calibration data,
and reconstruction data.

This projects comes with a first set of datasets that covering the most interesting
cases to get started with MPI. New datasets can be easily added and researcher wordwide 
are invited to contribute own datasets.

## Contribution

We invite you to contribute to this project and provide your own MPI data. Please open an
[issue](https://github.com/MagneticParticleImaging/OpenMPIData.jl/issues) to discuss how
to add your data to the project.

## Contact

If you have problems using the datasets, find mistakes, or have general questions please use
